A man who looked like an evil Will Ferrell just walked past Pike Place Market. I turned to my sister and she had the exact same
thought, which makes me wonder if we really did see Will Ferrell and he was just having a particularly terrible day.

AN UNORDERED COLLECTION OF CURSED IDEAS I HAVE ACCUMULATED IN MY NOTES APP:
<ul>
    <li>A hat with ear holes</li>
    <li>A pie with either a bell pepper or an entire slice of charred and incinerated toast inside</li>
    <li>Meat flavored hint water</li>
    <li>Sticking as many phone holders as possible on a car and using them as a widescreen display</li>
    <li>A trombone with two degrees of freedom</li>
    <li>Getting your face tattooed on your face, but slightly smaller</li>
    <li>Keeping your bangs long and then cutting eyeholes in them</li>
    <li>Dyeing your hair either translucent, vantablack[the darkest chemically synthesized paint on earth], or skin tone</li>
    <li>A smell every smell in the world Guinness World Record speedrun category</li>
    <li>Carbonated clam chowder</li>
    <li>Homing smells- smells that once opened, pathfind their way to a target</li>
    <li>A fancy restaurant where they give you a single chopstick to eat soup with</li>
    <li>Slicing a potato by smashing it through the strings of a guitar</li>
    <li>Inflatable dobok that turns into sparring gear</li>
    <li>Hinged hard shell taco</li>
    <li>A pasta shape that is just a massive flaccid wheel with a million spokes so you think you’re eating a bowl of pasta but it’s just an absurdly long single pasta network</li>
</ul>

I've been thinking about expanding my culinary palette and getting into slurries and gruels.

<b>ROOMMATE AGREEMENT:</b>
<br/>
About a year ago, I moved into a new dorm suite with a few of my friends and we had to fill out a series of questions that 
would lay down the ground rules for how we should live and interact with each other. Here is what we ended up settling on:

<img width = "600" src = {room4}/>

We went to the Mattress Firm the other day to look at mattresses and we had the most incredible mattress salesman.
Every time he introduced a new mattress to us he'd walk over to the mattress and slap it like a car salesman would slap
a car, and say something like "This tempurpedic mattress has patented cooling technology." Best hour and a half of my life.
